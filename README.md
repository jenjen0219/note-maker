# Note Taker - Express.js 

## Description
Note Taker is an application that allows users to write and save notes. The application has a user-friendly front end and utilizes an Express.js back end to store and retrieve note data from a JSON file. With Note Taker, users can easily create new notes and view existing notes.

I spent a lot of time on getting heroku set up, more than I'd like to admit but with some tutor help I was finally able to realize that part of my issue had been from me making multiple heroku projects. I also made the mistake of rearranging certain files that later on prevented me from properly routing from each page in the website. Even though users are not able to delete their notes (yet), I am still happy to see that users are being redirected to the right page, can have their previous notes appear, and create new notes!
